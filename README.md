## Hi there 👋

I know you’re here to read my professional bio but first, a few fun facts about me to break the ice!

🐱 I’m an animal lover through and through, cats and puffins are my absolute favorites. One of my dreams is to visit the puffin islands in Scotland someday 🐧. I’m also a nature enthusiast and a proud introvert yes, a bit ironic, but here we are!

🌱 Why did I choose tech as a career?
I’ve always been drawn to the beauty of small, intricate systems: puzzles, patterns, and how things connect. That fascination naturally evolved into a love for technical architecture, the way systems align, communicate, and build into something greater than the sum of their parts. I inspire to work on platforms and extremely passionate to learn everything and anything in this domain. Now let's talk professionally: 

🚀 DevOps & Cloud Engineer here with a hands-on experience designing scalable, secure, and automated cloud-native infrastructure. I specialize in AWS, and am actively focused further on building cloud-agnostic architectures using tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible, and Docker.

💡 Passionate about streamlining software delivery through CI/CD pipelines, enabling GitOps workflows, and empowering teams to ship faster with confidence. I’ve worked across multiple cloud platforms including AWS, GCP, and DigitalOcean, helping startups and teams build resilient systems from the ground up.

🔁 Strong believer in automation, reliability, and continuous improvement. Currently immersed in managing Kubernetes-based platforms, optimizing workloads with tools like Karpenter and ArgoCD, and driving infrastructure as code practices across the stack.

📚 Lifelong learner! I upskilled through the TechWorld with Nana DevOps Bootcamp last year, and constantly experiment with new tools, patterns, and best practices in the DevOps space.

⚡💡My goal is to keep on working in spaces accelerating in Platform engineering, Devops, Cloud and moving forward to Ai integrations in this particular space.
